File descriptions:

Meta-community-pitfall_traps_Primer.pwk:  Script used in the Primer-E program to analyze how ground arthropod beta diversity is affected by grassland connectivity.

Meta-community-sticky-cards_Primer.pwk:  Script used in Primer-E to evaluate how flying arthropod beta diversity is impacted by grassland connectivity.

Meta_ecosystems.Rproj:  The R Studio Project that hosts the R environment to run most of the analyses.

Pitfall_analysis_all_years_Final-Final.R:  The underlying R code to analyze the impacts of connectivity on ground arthropod abundance, alpha diversity, and trophic interactions using structural equation modeling.

Pitfall_data_Yale_Myers_Final.csv:  Data collected to estimate how ground arthropods are affected by connectivity treatments. This file supports the data shown in Figures 1 and 3 of the manuscript.

Pitfall_data_Yale_Myers_Primer.xlsx:  Data collected to estimate how ground arthropod beta diversity is affected by connectivity treatments. This file supports the data shown in Figure 2 of the manuscript.

Sticky_trap_analysis_all_Final-Final.R:  The R code used to analyzed the effects of connectivity on flying arthropod abundance and alpha diversity.

Sticky_traps_Yale_Myers_Final.csv:  Data collected to test how flying arthropods are affected by connectivity treatments.

Sticky_traps_Yale_Myers_Primer.xlsx:  Data collected to estimate how flying arthropod beta diversity is affected by connectivity treatments. This file supports the data shown in Figure 2 of the manuscript.

Note: All R files must be imported into your working directory for the analysis to work. The community composition analyses were conducted using the Primer-E program.
